# Sparks

Sparks is the beginnings of a game that I made for Macintosh back around 2000 (not sure of the exact year). I don’t remember being particularly serious about turning it into a real game, but I did want to at least write serious game code.

The code is also present in /game/space, this directory houses an attempt to get the original classic Macintosh code running.

## Features

- 256-color palette I designed. The palette has a few weird choices. It consists mostly of color ramps as you might expect from a game running in 8-bit color mode, but it includes a lot of ramps to gray which seem like dubious choices in retrospect. The palette also includes a couple rainbows, which means that I liked colors even back then.

- Triangle renderer with gourad shading. Probably not “production-quality” but it worked.

- Star field with parallax.

- Cool particle effects.
